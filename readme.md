## Abstract

Cervical cancer poses a serious health risk to women all across the world. The advancements in deep learning (DL), have driven the rise of DL-assisted cervical
cytology screening methods for various diagnostic tasks. However, most of these
DL approaches are susceptible to the inherent bias in clinical datasets, which
restricts their practical deployment. A key source of bias in DL-based cervical
cytology workflows is the high variability in the representation of various features
extracted by these models across different classes. This imbalanced feature
representation results in inconsistent model performance across different feature
cohorts, which is known as feature bias. Building on this understanding, our work
underscores the importance of mitigating feature bias in DL-based cervical
cytology workflows. We demonstrate that effective bias mitigation reduces
skewness in performance metrics, which improves diagnostic performance and enhances patient outcomes.
